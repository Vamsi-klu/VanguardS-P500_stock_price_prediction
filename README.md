# VanguardS-P500_stock_price_prediction
Here i took a dataset from Yahoo finance and built models like Auto Regression Integrated Mean Average(ARIMA),LSTM(Long Short Term Memory),MLP(Multi Layer Perceptron)
The data is past 20 Years 
Here i took the "Close" Value in the Dataset to make Future Stock Prediction
I detailly explained in code why i am implementing Certain parameters and tried to put as much as comments just to make sure you understand clearly
This is my Project and i uploaded all the files and dataset which i implemented
